# My Menu

It's an Order Management System for restaurants, composed of three parts integrated.

- link:backend[Backend (Java)]
- link:web[Website (Angular)]
- link:mobile[Mobile App (Ionic)]

Each part has its own specific purpose. 

The Website was responsible for the Restaurant's administrative view allowing the owner to visualize and manage incoming orders as well the management of the Restaurant's Menu.

The Mobile App allowed the Customer to check Restaurant's Menu and make orders

And the backend integrated everything through REST services. 

This project is incomplete and not currently in development.
It was an entrepreneurial endeavor that I have taken with a Friend that we have decided to not focus more.
It was a great experience anyway =].
